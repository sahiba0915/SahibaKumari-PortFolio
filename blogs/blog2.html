            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p>As we all know AI or <strong>"Artificial Intelligence"</strong> had hit the market since few years very
                much.
                So, now it has became a curiosity among the tech enthusiast to learn and know more about this topic.
                So, the first thing that comes to our mind is what is AI? <br><br>
                AI stands for Artificial Intelligence by the name it indicates the "Intelligence" that is "Artificially"
                generated.
                So, in simple words AI is a field of computer science that deals with making machines intelligent so
                that they can think like a human being.
                AI is an emerging trend for today and is doing great in many fields from medical sectors to the
                industrial sectors and many more.</p>

            <h1>Let's talk about one of the applications of AI which is widely used now a days:-</h1>

            <p>In this blog, I will be covering a very exciting application of AI i.e;.</p>

            <h1>"The ChatBot"</h1>

            <p>A ChatBot is an Artificial Intelligence software that can stimulate a conversation with a user in natural
                language through messaging applications, websites etc.<br>
                Today almost every sectors right from online teaching platforms to banking sectors and many more are
                using this application of AI to provide a better, easy and efficient method for interaction between
                human and machine.</p>

            <p>There are basically two steps in which ChatBot works:-</p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>User Request Analysis</li>
                <li>Returning the Response.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>


    <!-- Section-2-->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container container-center">
            <h1>User Request Analysis</h1>
            <p>In this step, the ChatBot analysis the user request to know the user intent and extract the relevant
                entities to provide a best solution. It is very important and core step because without input you will
                not be able to produce any result.
            </p>

    </section>


    <!-- Section-3 -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container container-center">
            <h1>Returning the response:-</h1>
            <p>Now, when the user's purpose is being identified by the chatbot, it's time for the most appropriate
                response.</p>
            <p><strong>The responses may be:-</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>a generic and predefined text.</li>
                <li>data stored in enterprise system and many more.....</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Section-4 -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container container-center">
            <h1>Importance of ChatBot:-</h1>
            <p>Now, talking about the chatbot's importance, I will point out the important most ones;</p>

            <b>"Inspite of everything a machine provides,a human intervention will always play a important role and will
                be a reason behind making any machine intelligent to think like a human being."</b>
